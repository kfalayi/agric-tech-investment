# Global investment in agriculture technology is leaving Africa behind.

This is an analysis that looks at how much funding has gone into agriculture technology startups globall. Rather than do a year-by-year analysis
of funding investors are putting into agritech startups, this looks at all investments. Data was sourced from [CBInsights]() database of agritech startups globally.
The main reason of this project is to visualize the analysis in an easy-to-grasp way with scrollytelling. So, a tree map seems like a great idea.

In the the analysis [notebook](https://github.com/kfalayi/agric-tech-investment/blob/main/agritech.ipynb), I look at the sum of all investments in startups which amounts to $37.8billion. 
## Most important findings
- Biotech is the solution area of agriculture technology getting most of the funding, with 45 percent of all investments.
- Only a $10,000 investment is on the database as funding for a biotech startup in Africa. This is filtered out in visualization due to scale.
- US/North America is where the majority of biotech investments are made.
- Only 0.9 percent of all investments is made in Africa.
- When weighed against population, Africa ranks lowest despite more investments than Oceania.
- Investment per capita in Africa amounts to 0.6 dollar to every citizen of an African country. In comparison, there are $40 in investment for every resident of a North American country. 
- Oceanic which where the lowest investment is made also has a higher investment per capita than Africa - 5.6 dollars to every resident of an Oceanic country.
