# Global investment in agriculture technology is leaving Africa behind.

This is an analysis that looks at how much funding has gone into agriculture technology startups globall. Rather than do a year-by-year analysis
of funding investors are putting into agritech startups, this looks at all investments. Data was sourced from [CBInsights]() database of agritech startups globally.
The main reason of this project is to visualize the analysis in an easy-to-grasp way with scrollytelling. So, a tree map seems like a great idea.

In the the analysis [notebook](https://github.com/kfalayi/agric-tech-investment/blob/main/agritech.ipynb), I look at the sum of all investments in startups which amounts to $37.8billion. 
## Most important findings
Then I looked at which solution area of agriculture technology is getting most of the funding. Biotech takes 45 percent of all investments.
I also look at which countries and continents are the most investments in biotech directed. Unsurprising there that it is the US/North America.
I calculated the percentage of all funding which are made on the Africn continent. It amounts to 0.9 percent. When weighed against population. It ranks lowest. For every African, there is 0.6 dollar in investment. In comparison, there are $40 in investment for every resident of a North American country. Oceanic which where the lowest investment is made also has a higher investment per capita than Africa - 5.6 dollars to every resident of an Oceanic country.
